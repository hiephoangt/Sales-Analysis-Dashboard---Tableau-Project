# Sales Data Analysis and Visualization with Tableau

## Overview

This project involves analyzing sales data from multiple sources and presenting insights through interactive dashboards in Tableau. The data spans several key areas of sales, including orders, customers, locations, and products. The focus of the analysis is to highlight trends in sales, profit, and customer behavior, with the goal of deriving actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Data Sources

The analysis was conducted on the following datasets:
- **Orders**: Contains information on individual sales transactions, including order date, quantity, sales amount, and profit.
- **Customers**: Details customer information such as customer ID, name, and purchase history.
- **Location**: Geographic data related to the sales, such as country, state, and city.
- **Products**: Contains product information, including category, subcategory, and product names.

## Dashboards

### 1. Sales Dashboard
This dashboard provides an overview of key sales metrics and trends. The main visualizations include:
- **Sparklines for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Quantity**: Show short-term trends in sales performance.
- **Bar Chart: Sales and Profit by Subcategory**: Highlights which product subcategories contribute the most to sales and profitability.
- **Line Chart: Sales and Profit Trend Over Time**: Displays the overall growth and fluctuation in sales and profit over a specific time period.

## Key Insights

### 1. Sales Dashboard
- **Insight 1: Sales Growth (20.36% YoY)**: 
  - Sales saw a significant increase in 2023 compared to the previous year, growing by 20.36%. This growth is particularly pronounced in the latter half of the year, likely due to effective sales strategies, new product launches, and increased market demand. Additionally, the rise in consumption may be attributed to important events and holidays towards the end of the year, driving higher consumer spending.
    
- **Insight 2: Profit Growth (14.24% YoY)**: 
  - Profit also increased but at a lower rate (14.24% YoY), suggesting that while sales are rising, profit margins might be under pressure. This could be due to rising costs or discount promotions, indicating that the business should optimize costs in lower-margin product categories.
  
- **Insight 3: Product Category Performance**: 
  - Categories such as Phones, Chairs, and Hardcovers have demonstrated strong sales and profitability. In contrast, categories like Machinery and Home Appliances generate sales but incur losses in profit, possibly due to high operational costs, warranty requirements, or low competition, affecting profitability.
  
- **Insight 4: Sales and Profit Fluctuations Over Time**: 
  - Trends in sales and profit exhibit significant month-to-month fluctuations, particularly in April and November. Months with higher profits may correlate with marketing campaigns, promotions, or seasonal demand, while months with declines may indicate off-peak seasons or supply chain disruptions.

### 2. Customer Dashboard
- **Insight 1: Increase in Total Customers (8.62% YoY)**: 
  - The total number of customers increased by 8.62%, signaling positive market expansion. However, average sales per customer ($1,058) showed only a slight increase (10.80% YoY), indicating moderate growth in individual customer spending.
  
- **Insight 2: Distribution of Order Frequency**: 
  - A significant number of customers (400 individuals) only placed 1 or 2 orders, suggesting that while new customer acquisition is strong, customer retention may need improvement. The business should focus on loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases.
  
- **Insight 3: Top 10 Customers Contribute Significantly to Profit**: 
  - The top 10 customers account for a substantial portion of the profit. For example, Tom Ash generated $4,599 in profit with just 2 orders, highlighting the importance of high-value customer segments. Developing personalized marketing strategies for these customers could enhance profitability.

### Overall Insights
Both dashboards illustrate steady growth in sales and customer numbers, but profit margins pose a significant challenge. Although sales and customer counts are expanding, profit is under pressure, particularly in categories like Machinery and Home Appliances. Furthermore, a small group of high-value customers significantly contributes to profit, indicating a need for the business to focus on customer retention and product cost optimization to improve overall profitability.

### Summary:
- Strong sales growth, but profit margins require attention.
- Effective customer acquisition, but improvement in customer retention is needed.
- Focusing on key product categories and high-value customers can lead to significant business improvement opportunities.
